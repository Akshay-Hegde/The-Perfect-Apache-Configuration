<h3>The Perfect Apache Configuration</h3>
I've spent quite a bit of time compiling what I find to be optimial to me and my server.
Feel free to fork this and make it your own.

<h3>Installation</h3>
Copy and paste into /apache2/httpd.conf

You can also copy and paste into .htaccess - however this is slower.
